For dfs in this proj,
generation time check won't get the exact solution as expected by the test

for test_cases/q1/graph_bfs_vs_dfs.test
starting from the root node, state A,
when expanding A, generating B, G, and D,
at generation time of B, G, and D, they are checked if they are goals
because G is a goal state,
so, dfs will directly return A->G as the solution
however, the test is looking for a deeper solution......


also, because in the assignment spec, it is stated that we are supposed to avoid expand the already visited states/nodes
we can see that in this project, expanding a node = visiting a node
so, here, instead of keeping all generated states, 
we need to keep all expanded states
